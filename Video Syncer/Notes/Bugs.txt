Bug where video switches from buffering to playing over and over
	I think this is started by a user buffering, basically whenever a video loads in.
	The user tells the server they are buffering.
	The user finishes buffering, starts playing.
	The server still thinks you are buffering, sets your state to buffering.
	The server sets your time to when you started buffering, because the time does not continue when buffering.
	The user player sets state to buffering because the server says so.
	The user player sets state to playing because buffering is done.
	The server says the user is buffering.
	The user sets their state to buffering.
	And so on and so on...

	Bug fixed?
	Caused by the videoPlayer.js, mixing up the "state" and "stateNumber" variables in different
	methods caused each variable to be wrong. Changed "state" variable to "stateText" to be more clear
	for future reference.
	Also removed some server code that tries to handle buffering.
